Hide the plugin from the plugin list
 
== Description ==

Hidden Plugin is a light-weight plugin that gives a single admin user the ability to hide plugins prevent them from being activated, deactivated, or deleted by clients and other users, including administrators. By activating Hide Plugins, you will be able to see all plugins and a toggle to hide each plugin from selected user on the Plugins page.
 
== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =
* WordPress 3.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic Installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Hide Plugins, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Hide Plugins" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you're sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= What does it hide?=
Hidden Plugin does one thing: it prevent plugins from appearing on the Plugins page in your WordPress dashboard for selected users. Any other areas of the dashboard that may be affected by hidden plugins, like settings pages and dashboard widgts, will not be hidden.
